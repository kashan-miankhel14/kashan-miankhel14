# Hi, I'm Kashan 👋

🎓 **Final-year Software Engineering student** based in Pakistan  
🔐 **Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional** — Ethical Hacker | Penetration Tester | Red Teamer

## 🔐 Why Cybersecurity?

I've always been fascinated by how systems work — and how attackers find ways to break them. I believe security is at the heart of modern technology, and I want to help companies protect their digital assets by finding vulnerabilities before real attackers do.

### 🐛 **Bug Bounty Practice**
Learning web application testing techniques for platforms like:
- HackerOne

- ✅ **Document my learning journey** with step-by-step problem-solving approaches
- ✅ **Share progress and certificates** on LinkedIn to connect with the community
- ✅ **Build public labs** to test skills and create a portfolio of real-world security work
