## 🔐 Why Cybersecurity?

I've always been fascinated by how systems work — and how attackers find ways to break them. I believe security is at the heart of modern technology, and I want to help companies protect their digital assets by finding vulnerabilities before real attackers do.

## 🚀 What I'm Doing Right Now

I'm actively building my skills and experience through:

### 🎯 **Hands-On Learning Platforms**
- **TryHackMe**: Yearly subscriber completing CTF challenges and learning paths (Jr Penetration Tester, Red Teaming)
- **Hack The Box**: Practicing on real-world machines and HTB Academy modules for Advanced AD and exploit development

### 📚 **Certifications & Courses**
- **ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** — Currently studying for this globally recognized certification
- **Python Scripting** for cybersecurity automation
- **Penetration Testing & Ethical Hacking** courses with documented certificates

### 🐛 **Bug Bounty Practice**
Learning web application testing techniques for platforms like:
- HackerOne
- Bugcrowd

---

## 🛠️ How I Prove My Skills

I believe practical work speaks louder than theory:

- ✅ **Write detailed writeups** of CTF rooms and machine walkthroughs on GitHub
- ✅ **Document my learning journey** with step-by-step problem-solving approaches
- ✅ **Share progress and certificates** on LinkedIn to connect with the community
- ✅ **Build public labs** to test skills and create a portfolio of real-world security work

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

My goal is to join a team as a:
- **Junior Penetration Tester**
- **SOC Analyst** 
- **Red Team Trainee**

**What I can offer:**
- Apply practical knowledge gained from hands-on learning
- Continuous learning mindset with mentorship
- Help organizations stay secure in real-world environments

**I'm open to:**
- Entry-level roles (remote or local)
- Internships
