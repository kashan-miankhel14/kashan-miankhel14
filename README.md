## 🔐 Why Cybersecurity + DevOps?

I've always been fascinated by how systems work — and how attackers find ways to break them. But I believe that security shouldn't be an afterthought. That's why I'm passionate about **DevSecOps** — building security into every stage of the development lifecycle. I want to help companies protect their digital assets not just by finding vulnerabilities, but by building secure, automated, and resilient systems from the ground up.

## 🚀 What I'm Doing Right Now

I'm actively building my skills and experience through:

### 🎯 **Hands-On Learning Platforms**
- **TryHackMe**: Yearly subscriber completing CTF challenges and learning paths (Jr Penetration Tester, Red Teaming)
- **Hack The Box**: Practicing on real-world machines and HTB Academy modules for Advanced AD and exploit development

### 📚 **Certifications & Courses**
- **ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** — Currently studying for this globally recognized certification
- **Python Scripting** for cybersecurity automation and DevOps pipelines
- **Penetration Testing & Ethical Hacking** courses with documented certificates
- **Docker & Kubernetes** for containerization and orchestration
- **AWS Cloud Practitioner** — Learning cloud services and security
- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Jenkins & GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipelines
- **Machine Learning Operations** — Learning ML model deployment and monitoring

### 🐛 **Bug Bounty Practice**
Learning web application testing techniques for platforms like:
- HackerOne
- Bugcrowd

## 🛠️ How I Prove My Skills

I believe practical work speaks louder than theory:

- ✅ **Write detailed writeups** of CTF rooms and machine walkthroughs on GitHub
- ✅ **Document my learning journey** with step-by-step problem-solving approaches
- ✅ **Share progress and certificates** on LinkedIn to connect with the community
- ✅ **Build public labs** to test skills and create a portfolio of real-world security work
